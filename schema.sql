If you grapple then you should be able to do at least a basic Double Leg.
This takedown is a mainstay in BJJ, Wrestling and MMA (unfortunately the Judo illuminati has completely banned it, to the detriment of the sport in my opinion).
You can’t use the Double Leg if you’re afraid of commitment: you have to hit it hard and fast.  But it’s also NOT just a football or a rugby tackle – this is a highly technical maneuver with sophisticated setups and follow-ups.
There are lots of different variations for the Double Leg.  The biggest differences between these variations include head position (is the head to the side or in the middle of the chest) and whether you drop down to your lead knee as you shoot (the penetration step).
Many Freestyle Wrestlers use the penetration step because their opponents are usually quite bent over and they need to get as low as possible to hit this move.  In MMA it’s more common to stay up on the feet, but both variations are equally valid for BJJ.

2) Single Leg Takedown
The Single Leg Takedown is another hugely important technique in Wrestling with a lot of application in BJJ.  Watch Bernardo Faria compete in the BJJ Mundials: in almost every match he pulls half guard, secures a Single Leg, comes up to his feet, and takes his opponent down.
Basically you reach down, grab one of his legs, lift it off the ground, and topple him over.  There are a LOT of subtleties that you have to observe when you do that though, and changing the position of your hands, your head, or your body by a couple of inches can change this from a high-percentage takedown to an ineffective waste of your energy that lands you in a bad place.
Single Legs turn into Double Legs, and Double Legs can turn into Single Legs depending on your opponent’s reaction.  They are often chained together.
Note that for BJJ and Submission Wrestling you have to be careful about putting your head to the outside of your opponent’s body (or let him force it to the outside) because a) it’s illegal at white belt in IBJJF competition, and b) it does expose you to the guillotine. There is no 100% safe technique, and the head-outside position does offer some very strong finishes if you move quickly and pass the guard


3) Low Single
While technically still a Single Leg takedown the mechanics and finishes of the Low Single are so different that it’s worth considering it as a separate technique.
Basically you get as low as you can go, shoot forward, cup your opponent’s heel with your hand, and then drive forward to take him down.  Depending on his reactions to that initial attack there are a LOT of different ways to finish the technique once you’re in on his foot. 
Some wrestlers have built their entire career around this attack (go look at John Smith wrestling footage from the eighties and nineties).  It has been used in MMA on occasion by both Randy Couture and one of my own coaches, Erik Paulson.  And you see it all the time in BJJ competition, with competitors shooting for it both from outside of gripping range and after they’ve tied up with their opponents.

4) Ankle Pick
The Ankle Pick technique is a relatively low risk, high reward attack that can land you in a great position for passing the guard.
This was a favorite attack of one of the highest-level wrestlers I ever trained with.  He would get an over-hook from the clinch, fake Uchi Mata to get one of your legs off the ground, then quickly step in and hit an ankle pick on the supporting leg.  You knew exactly what was coming but it still worked almost every time!
In BJJ the ankle pick is often applied using a lapel grip.  This grip can be used to yank your opponent forward, forcing him to step towards you with at least one of his legs.  This brings his foot within range, allowing you to apply the Ankle Pick.
As described in the second video below it is also often used in combination with a fake guard pull; their reaction to the guard pull sets up and amplifies the effectiveness of the ankle pick.

("Escaping Dominant Position", "Jiu Jitsu", "1)	The 4 Most Common Errors for The ‘Upa’ Mount Escape
The ‘Upa’ (or ‘Bridge and Roll’) is probably the very first mount escape that a beginner ever learns. It’s taught as part of the basic curriculum for a very simple reason: it works! 
Lots of people can do the Upa mount escape perfectly in perfectly when they’re banging out uncontested repetitions: step 1, step 2, step 3 and so on…
But as soon as you add the element of stress (i.e. sparring or live training) their technique begins to fall apart. In the heat of the moment they start skipping steps, which leads to an ineffective escape and a giant waste of energy…
Plus staying stuck in the bottom of mount, which really, really sucks!
Here are the four most common errors I’ve seen beginners make while trying to upa their way out of mount for real…
Mistake 1: Trying to do this escape before getting at least one of your opponent’s hands to the floor
Mistake 2: Staying in the bridged (upa) position for the entire escape
Mistake 3: Not trapping their opponent’s leg and arm on the same side (or trying to trap BOTH legs at the same time)
Mistake 4: Rolling without your hips being fully bridged first
2)	Side Control Top Position
Having Your wrist under the neck and another hand under our opponent’s belly or armpit and just try to bridge and lift will never work. If your opponent’s just clamp down having good control of your body and pinning your arm to your body, you won’t make it.
In that position, your opponent is using the best possible leverage. He’s pressuring your wrist to pin your arm. It’s terrible because you’re forced to use your triceps to create a distance. And against strong and heavy guy it’s going to be impossible. So, what we really want to do is to use a bone structure.
People will say here that your opponent will just push your arm through an arm triangle you. But what really happens then is, that you’re already ready to go for escape. Your opponent in this situation is pressing against your elbow and compressing your bone from your elbow to shoulder. And bones are designed to take force along their length.
So, whenever you get into position to use your wrist go a bit deeper with your arm to make your opponent pressure your elbow to shoulder bone. After that, it’s just a big and simple side bridge and after that, you rotate and bring your knee, the one closer to your opponent, between you and him.
You’re moving your opponent with your elbow and not with your hands. You should use the strength of a bone structure and not muscular structure to take the force.

3)	Stuck in North-South Position
The North-South position is a variation of side control, where the opponent is actually on top of your head. More precisely, their belly should be on your head. Their elbows must go under your elbows, or you’ll be able to use frames. Furthermore, they usually keep their knees tucked in, creating a tight position around your head and shoulders. In certain situations, they might be sprawled out, exerting lots of pressure.
Escaping the position won’t happen unless you manage to get your structure in order. This means defending first, before looking to get out and even counter, should the opportunity arise.
By defending the North-South position, I mean denying your opponent the controls they need to proceed to attack. The first step in any defense strategy would be to prevent the position beforehand. However, as we said, the goal today is to look at North-South escapes once we’re neck deep.
The first order of business is looking to collect your arms close to your chest. This serves two major purposes that are essential for any impending North-South escapes. The first one is to deny the opponent control over your upper arms and elbows. This will make holding you in place really difficult. The second purpose is to create a structure that will allow you to create space between you and your opponent.
When defending the North-South position, creating space between you and your opponent is everything. Without space, you’ll be in a  hand fighting battle which probably won’t end well for you. Once you have space, do an Upa. Now, you can actually move and cause all kinds of trouble to your opponent. Space is the foundation of all North-South defenses, that can eventually lead into escapes or even counters.
Actually escaping the position is going to require some timing and technique in addition to creating space and denying control. With Noth-South escapes, you can either roll out or roll your opponent over.
The first escape is a fairly simple one. Once you have a successful defense structure, your goal is to use your arms to trap the opponent’s forearms to the mats. To do this, you’ll need to open your elbows to your sides but keep them on top of the opponent’s arms. Next, you’ll need to move fast and get the both your arms on the same side of the opponent’s head. Push on the neck with one arm to get the other to that side. Afterward, establish grips over and in both armpits. Escaping now is as easy as rotating toward the opponent on the opposite side of their head.
The second escape is probably even simpler. The same basic defense principles apply, but now, instead of pinning the arms you’ll keep your arms tightly on your chest. You’ll use the Upa to create space and a frame. To do that, do the bridge, but leave your arms extended when you go back down. Now you have enough space to tuck your knees towards your chin. This will get your knees in between you and your opponent. Once you’re there, get both your arms to the triceps of their arms, near the armpits. At the same time, thread both knees on the biceps on each arm. Rock with your feet towards the mats and your opponent is going to fly right over.
"),
("Submissions", "Jiu Jitsu", "1)	Arm-Bar from the Mount
You are in the mounted position and your opponent straightens their arms, giving you the perfect opportunity for an arm-bar. Place your right hand on your opponent’s chest in between their arms.
Take your left arm round the outside of your opponent’s right arm and place it on your right hand. This is isolating the arm you are about to perform the arm-bar on. Put all of your weight on your hands and hop to your feet. Now still with all your weight on your opponent’s chest, swing your left foot round the top of your opponent’s head to finish in the position shown.
Now simply sit down next to your opponent. You should aim to be as close as possible to their right shoulder. As you sit down you will notice that you have your opponent’s arm in a perfect position to apply the arm-bar.
Grab your opponent’s right arm and lay back. To apply the lock simply raise your hips off the ground, just an inch of movement should cause pain to your opponent. Be sure that your opponent’s thumb is pointing up, so their arm is perfectly locked. Also squeeze your knees together slightly for a solid hold.
2)	How to Master the Rear Naked Choke
In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the rear naked choke is a very important attack. To apply this attack, start in the rear mount position, controlling your opponent with the over-under grip. It's important that your bottom hand grabs your top wrist and not the other way around.
After you've mastered the first position, grip your opponent's opposite (right) shoulder with your top (left) hand. This step resembles a “tiger claw,” because your fingers are in a claw shape as they grip the back of his right shoulder. This makes your grip fiercer.
With your left hand, regrip the shoulder. At the same time, shoot your right hand forward to knock his right hand off of your forearm, limiting your foe's ability to block your choke. This is a quick motion, almost like a palm strike to your rival's wrist. You don't want to push his hand slowly or leave your hand dangling out there for him to grab. It's your goal to end this conflict as quickly and effectively as possible.
You'll now return to the palm-to-palm grip from step three. In this step, the noose around his neck is much tighter, and his primary defense—his right hand—has been removed from your forearm. Note how in the photo the elbow is positioned directly in front of the opponent's nose. Ideally, your forearm will be placed under his jaw and not across your foe's face or chin.
In this final step, you'll need to shoot your right hand deep behind your opponent's neck and lock it into place using pressure from your own head. Your left hand should be on your right bicep. You will squeeze down and then in and up, in a hooking motion under your foe's jaw.

You will also stretch your opponent out by extending your legs and arching your back to make the choke even more powerful.

3)	Kimura from Closed Guard
In Brazil this sequence is often taught as one of the most basic attacks from the guard. You start with your opponent in the closed guard and a grip on his sleeve and lapel.
With your sleeve grip you pull your opponent’s hand to the ground. At the same time you open your guard, escape your hips, sit up and reach over his triceps with the hand that had been on his lapel.
Reach your second hand over and through his arm and grab your own wrist. It is very important to have his arm, especially his upper arm, trapped tight against your chest.
Now, with his arm firmly trapped, keeping his hand well away from his body (so it will be harder to defend) escape your hips out to the side of his trapped arm. The act of escaping your hips is the most important part of this move. Scissor his body with your legs, keeping your calf firmly pressing down on his lower back – this keeps him from rolling. To apply the lock from here you do two things: A) move his elbow towards his head – this takes all the slack out of the system, B) try to bring his hand to the back of his head. Unless he is made of cooked spaghetti you now have him trapped in the Kimura lock.

("Salsa", "Dance", "All music has a beat or basic rhythm to it that can be counted. Music has a certain number of beats per measure, which is usually 3,4 or 6 beats. In salsa music, there are 2 measures with 4 beats per measure. The basic salsa dance step uses 8 beats. 
•	Try clapping the rhythm of the music while counting 1-8.
•	Beginners should use salsa music that has a slower beat and an accented percussion. This will help you hear the beat in the music.
The basic salsa step uses 8 beats to complete, however you don’t step on all 8 beats.
Your feet move on beats 1,2,3 with a pause on beat 4; you step again on beats 5,6,7 and pause on beat 8.
•	Clap when you will be stepping, and don’t clap when you don’t step to understand the rhythm of the dance step.
•	The rhythm will be clap-clap-clap-pause-clap-clap-clap-pause. Repeat this rhythm throughout an entire song.
Try standing and marching your feet in place using the salsa rhythm you just clapped. Step your feet down on beats 1, 2, and 3, pausing on beat 4, and repeat the sequence for beats 5 through 8.
Mark the positions of the steps on the floor. Place numbered cards or sheet of paper on the floor to indicate where to place your feet while you dance.
Number 1 is your starting position, place it in the middle of the room.
Number 2 should be placed about 1 foot in front of number 1.
Number 3 should be placed about 1 foot behind number 1.
Number 4 should be placed about 1 foot behind number 3.
Start the dance with both feet in position 1. When you are ready to begin the salsa dance you will step to the next number.
Step forward to number 2 with your left foot on beat 1. You will alternate which foot you step with for each beat.
Rock back on your right foot on beat 2. Shift your weight from front to back to shift your body position. Swing your hips slightly to accentuate the movement.
Move your left foot back to number 3 on beat 3. Keep your weight on the ball of your foot when you step backwards. You will stay in this position during beat 4.
Roll your weight from the ball of your foot to the heel on beat 4. Do not move your feet during beat 4.
Step backwards with your right foot to number 4 on beat 5. Keep your left foot in place during step 5
Rock your body weight forward on your left foot on beat 6. Swing your hips as you shift your body weight to help add style to your salsa dance.
Step your right foot forward back to number 1 on beat 7. Keep your weight on the ball of your foot as you step your right foot forward.
Balance your weight on beat 8. Do not pick up your feet during step 8. This is the last count of the basic salsa step.
Repeat counts 1-8 again to continue the dance.
Practice the steps without music. Count the numbers of the beat and move your feet slowly to master the movement.
Add music once you are confident in the footwork.

("Foxtrot", "Dance", "Hold your partner in a closed ballroom position. Perform the foxtrot facing your partner and holding hands at all times. If you’re the lead, use your left hand to hold the follower’s right hand in a gentle clasp. Then place your right hand on the follower’s left shoulder blade. If you're the follower, place your left hand on the lead’s right shoulder blade.[1]
Position your clasped hands at the shoulder height of the follower.
Mirror the lead if you’re dancing the follower part. When dancing the foxtrot, it’s important that the leading and following roles are clear so the dance looks smooth and fluid. If you're the lead, take 1 step forward with your left foot. As a result, if you're the follower, take 1 step back with your right foot to create space. Similarly, if you're the lead, take 1 step to the left. Then if you're the follower, take 1 step to the right so that you and your partner move together.
Traditionally, the man is the lead and the woman is the follower.
Dance to the 4/4 timing of the foxtrot. Learning to dance the foxtrot is all about learning the right rhythm and sticking to the beat. 4/4 timing means that there are 4 beats to every 1 bar of music and the rhythm is slow, slow, fast, fast. The slow parts are equal to 2 beats of the music and the fast parts are equal to only 1 beat of the music. Listen to big band foxtrot music and count 4 beats out loud to hear the slow, slow, fast, fast rhythm.[3]
The 4/4 timing is one of the most important things to keep in mind while you’re learning the foxtrot.
Move around the dance floor with the basic foxtrot step and turn. It's relatively simple to dance the foxtrot to a whole song! Simply repeat the basic step with your partner to the beat of the music and move your way around the dance floor. If you encounter any obstacles such as objects or other dancers, perform a basic turn to change direction slightly.[5]
The foxtrot is a simple and elegant form of ballroom dancing. You can simply repeat the basic steps during your dance or you can learn more advanced steps as your confidence and skills develop.
Take 1 step forward with your left foot. Stand facing your partner with your feet together. This is called the closed position. Then use your left foot to take 1 step forward if you’re the lead. If you’re the follower, take 1 step back with your right foot to mirror the lead.
Step slowly so the step lasts 2 beats of the music.
Take a second step forward with your right foot. Repeat the same process so that you and your partner take 2 steps overall. However, this time step forward with your right foot instead of your left. If you’re the follower, take a second step back with your left foot.[8]
These are called walking steps.
This second step also takes 2 counts and follows the slow part of the foxtrot rhythm.
Use your left foot to take 1 sidestep to the left. This is the second part of the basic foxtrot step and it involves moving at a faster pace. If you’re the lead, step to the side and forward very slightly with your left foot. If you’re the follower, quickly step to the right using your right foot. Make sure to step back very slightly to give the lead room as they step forward.[9]
Complete the sidestep at the fast speed of the foxtrot rhythm. This is 1 beat of the music.
Perform the sidestep twice as quickly as you performed each walking step.
Bring your feet together to close the sidestep. The final part of the basic foxtrot step is to bring your sidestep to a close. If you’re the lead, bring your right foot to your left foot and position your feet close together. If you’re the follower, draw your left foot over to your right foot. Move at a fast foxtrot rhythm of 1 count of music.[10]
Overall, the 4 parts of the basic foxtrot step follow the slow, slow, fast, fast rhythm of 2, 2, 1, 1, in terms of counts. This means that you count 2 beats of the music while you perform the slow parts of the step and 1 beat of the music for the fast parts.
Do the sequence in a backward direction to perform a basic backward step. When you’re dancing the foxtrot, moving forward and backward requires the same sequence of steps, however, you simply switch direction. For example, if you’re the lead, take 1 slow step back with your left foot and then a second slow step back with your right foot. Then step to the side with your left foot and draw your right foot over to close the sidestep.[11]
It works in the same way if you’re the follower. Take 1 slow step forward with your right foot and then a second slow step forward with your left foot. Step right with your right foot and then bring your left foot over to complete the sidestep.

("Merengue", "Dance", "Start traveling across the floor. With this basic marching step (it's one heck of a sensual march), start moving back and forth, left and right. Men, take your partner slowly in a 360-degree turn. Don't rush the music or try to do some impressive double turn -- just take the full 8 beats (or even 16 if you're feeling groovy) to get around in a circle. The beauty of the merengue is in the slow, fluid movements.
Do 1-handed turns. It's turning time! While still doing the basic step, here are the basics:
Slight out into an open position. This basically means that the woman slides her hand that's around the man down his arm and grabs his hand -- both sets of hands are clasped now.
Grab either the left or right hand and drop the other. The man should lift the hand he chooses into the air, indicating to the women how to turn.
Then, the woman (or man, but the man usually follows in succession) turns to the inside or the outside underneath her arm -- the man will indicate this by turning the woman's hand to the right or left.
Keep the basic step going the entire time! Turn at the same pace you're stepping -- a casual 1, 2, 3, 4.
Do 2-handed turns. Slide out into the same open position you would for 1-handed turns, and, this time, lift both hands up into the air. From there:
The woman goes under both arms in a 360-degree turn. As a result, her arms are now crossed. To get out of this, you have two options:
The man can turn her back the opposite direction, just repeating the same move back the way she came.
The man can turn himself, uncrossing the arms as a result, returning to a normal, open stance.
Do the hammerlock turn. For this one, start the same as the 1-handed turn; that is, raise one hand up in the air but don't drop the other. Turn her to the outside -- as a result, she now has one of her arms wrapped around her back, one arm out, and is positioned at the man's side. The man's hand is resting on the woman's hip.
If you'd like, keep that momentum and turn in a slow, 360-degree circle. Then, unwind the woman by taking her free hand (the one not wrapped around her), and spin her back the other direction, resuming a normal stance.
Men, to make sure the woman takes a full turn, place your thumb on her hip and make her face you. It's just a slight repositioning of angles.
Do cuddle turns. This is the same as the hammerlock turn, only the lady turns to the inside. Because of this, both her arms get wrapped around her and she stands directly in front of the man (as opposed to at his side, like in the hammerlock). But then the man should move her to his side, both her arms still wrapped in front of her. You should now be standing hip to hip, facing the same direction.
Then, take that momentum and move around in a circle, the woman moving in a larger circle backward.
If you'd like, take the hand that's on her hip and push her to the other side of you. Then circle again!

("Beginner", "Yoga", "Here are five poses to help you get started
1)	Mountain Pose (Tadasana)
Stand with your big toes barely touching, and your heels slightly apart. A good way to gauge your stance is to see if your second toes are parallel.
Press into all four corners of your feet: big toe, little toe, right side heel, left side heel. As you push into your feet, feel how that engages your entire leg and keeps those muscles active.
Take a deep breath and roll your shoulders up and back, releasing them down, so your shoulder blades are resting toward each other and your neck is long.
Take a few deep breaths here. Close your eyes if you like.
2)	Forward Fold (Uttanasana)
On your inhale, lift your arms to the sides and up, over your head.
On your exhale, release your arms (either in front of your body or out to the side, like a swan dive) as you fold your torso over your legs. On the first time through, have at least a slight bend in your knees. No matter how flexible you are, your hamstrings will be cold when starting out, and you’ll want to be gentle with them.
As you relax into the pose more, begin to straighten your legs as far as feels good. Anything that pinches or is a shooting pain should immediately stop your movement. Let gravity do the work here — don’t pull yourself down and try to force the fold.
You can put your hands on your shins, your feet, or the floor. This passively lengthens your spine and your hamstrings, and it’s also a great way to work on balance.
3)	Plank Pose (Uttihita Chaturanga Dandasana)
From Forward Fold, put your hands flat on the floor, bending your knees as much as needed to do so. Step back one leg at a time, until you’re in a high Plank Pose.
Press into your hands, keep your legs parallel and engaged, and pull your bellybutton toward your spine.
Take a few deep breaths here, working your core and your arms.
It’s easy to drop a little too much and get “banana back” or to hunch your shoulders. A good way to figure this pose out as a beginner is to get a friend to look at the shape you’re making from the side.
Your upper body, from your hands on the floor, up to your hips, should be relatively straight, allowing for some curves due to natural spine curves.



4)	Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)
This pose elongates your spine, stretches your back leg muscles, and aids in digestion. Since it’s a mild inversion, it can release stress, help with headaches, and calm the nervous system. 
From Plank Pose, push into your hands and lift your hips up and back on the inhale. One thing that can be tricky with this pose is, again, keeping your shoulders engaged but not working too hard, and keeping a neutral spine.
Your legs should be straight, and your heels working toward the floor. There will probably be some space between your heels and the floor. You could be very flexible, but if your legs are a bit on the long side, you probably won’t have your heels all the way to the floor. That’s fine. Keep your legs active and heels reaching toward the ground.
Your first time in this pose, pedal out your feet a little to warm up your leg muscles.
5)	Child’s Pose (Balasana)
In any yoga class, this is a good pose to come to if you want to rest and reset your nervous system.
In Downward-Facing Dog, take a deep breath. On the exhale, release your knees to the floor, pull your hips back to your heels, and rest your forehead on the floor.
You can either leave your arms stretched in front of you or pull them next to your body, hands resting palms up near your feet.
This is a restorative pose, so adjust it to your needs. If you want to widen your knees a bit, do so. Like all forward folds, this pose is nurturing. It relaxes your spine, shoulders, and neck, and massages your internal organs.

("Intermediate", "Yoga", "Here are three intermediate Yoga poses for you to practice.
1)	Boat Pose
Sit on the floor with your legs straight in front of you. Press your hands on the floor a little behind your hips, fingers pointing toward the feet, and strengthen the arms. Lift through the top of the sternum and lean back slightly. As you do this make sure your back doesn't round; continue to lengthen the front of your torso between the pubis and top sternum. Sit on the tripod of your two sitting bones and tailbone.
Exhale and bend your knees, then lift your feet off the floor, so that the thighs are angled about 45-50 degrees relative to the floor. Lengthen your tailbone into the floor and lift your pubis toward your navel. If possible, slowly straighten your knees, raising the tips of your toes slightly above the level of your eyes. If this isn't possible remain with your knees bent, perhaps lifting the shins parallel to the floor.
Stretch your arms alongside the legs, parallel to each other and the floor. Spread the shoulder blades across your back and reach strongly out through the fingers. If this isn't possible, keep the hands on the floor beside your hips or hold on to the backs of your thighs.
While the lower belly should be firm, it shouldn't get hard and thick. Try to keep the lower belly relatively flat. Press the heads of the thigh bones toward the floor to help anchor the pose and lift the top sternum. Breathe easily. Tip the chin slightly toward the sternum so the base of the skull lifts lightly away from the back of the neck.
At first stay in the pose for 10-20 seconds. Gradually increase the time of your stay to 1 minute. Release the legs with an exhalation and sit upright on an inhalation.
2)	Dhanurasana (Bow Pose)
Lie on your belly with your hands alongside your torso, palms up. (You can lie on a folded blanket to pad the front of your torso and legs.) Exhale and bend your knees, bringing your heels as close as you can to your buttocks. Reach back with your hands and take hold of your ankles (but not the tops of the feet). Make sure your knees aren't wider than the width of your hips, and keep your knees hip width for the duration of the pose.
Inhale and strongly lift your heels away from your buttocks and, at the same time, lift your thighs away from the floor. This will have the effect of pulling your upper torso and head off the floor. Burrow the tailbone down toward the floor, and keep your back muscles soft. As you continue lifting the heels and thighs higher, press your shoulder blades firmly against your back to open your heart. Draw the tops of the shoulders away from your ears. Gaze forward.
With the belly pressed against the floor, breathing will be difficult. Breathe more into the back of your torso and be sure not to stop breathing.
Stay in this pose anywhere from 20 to 30 seconds. Release as you exhale, and lie quietly for a few breaths. You can repeat the pose once or twice more.


3)	Crane (Crow Pose)
Squat down from Tadasana with your inner feet a few inches apart. If it isn't possible to keep your heels on the floor, support them on a thickly folded blanket. Separate your knees wider than your hips and lean the torso forward, between the inner thighs. Stretch your arms forward, then bend your elbows, place your hands on the floor and the backs of the upper arms against the shins.
Snuggle your inner thighs against the sides of your torso, and your shins into your armpits, and slide the upper arms down as low onto the shins as possible. Lift up onto the balls of your feet and lean forward even more, taking the weight of your torso onto the backs of the upper arms. In Bakasana you consciously attempt to contract your front torso and round your back completely. To help yourself do this, keep your tailbone as close to your heels as possible.
With an exhalation, lean forward even more onto the backs of your upper arms, to the point where the balls of your feet leave the floor. Now your torso and legs are balanced on the backs of your upper arms. As a beginner at this pose, you might want to stop here, perched securely on the bent arms.
But if you are ready to go further, squeeze the legs against the arms, press the inner hands firmly to the floor and (with an inhalation) straighten the elbows. Seen from the side the arms are angled slightly forward relative to the floor. The inner knees should be glued to the outer arms, high up near the armpits. Keep the head in a neutral position with your eyes looking at the floor, or lift the head slightly, without compressing the back of the neck, and look forward.
Stay in the pose anywhere from 20 seconds to 1 minute. To release, exhale and slowly lower your feet to the floor, back into a squat.

("Advanced", "Yoga", "Here are two Advanced poses for you to take yoga to the next level
1)	Firefly Pose
Squat with your feet a little less than shoulder distance apart. Tilt your pelvis forward and bring your trunk between your legs. Keeping your trunk low, straighten your legs enough to lift your pelvis to about knee height.
Bring your left upper arm and shoulder as far as possible underneath the back of your left thigh just above the knee and place your left hand on the floor at the outside edge of your foot, fingers pointing forward. Repeat these actions on the other side.
Lift yourself off the floor by carefully shifting your center of gravity. Press your hands into the floor and slowly begin to rock your weight back, off your feet and onto your hands. Keep your inner thighs as high on your arms as possible.
With an inhalation, stretch your legs out to the sides as straight as you can, keeping your pelvis high to make your legs parallel to the floor.
Press through the bases of your big toes but pull your toes back toward your torso and spread them apart. The inner edges of your feet should be angled slightly forward, the outer edges slightly back.
Straighten your arms as much as possible. Hollow your chest as you widen your shoulder blades as much as possible; this will round your upper back, which will lift your torso higher.
Without tensing your neck, lift your head and gaze forward. Breathe slowly and hold the pose for 15 seconds or longer, then release your feet to the floor with an exhale.

2)	Lotus Pose
Sit on the floor with your legs straight in front. Bend your right knee and bring the lower leg up into a cradle: The outer edge of the foot is notched into the crook of the left elbow, the knee is wedged into the crook of the right elbow, and the hands are clasped (if possible) outside the shin. Lift the front torso toward the inner right leg so the spine lengthens (and the lower back does not round). Rock your leg back and forth a few times, exploring the full range of movement of the hip joint.
Bend the left knee and turn the leg out. Rock your right leg far out to the right, then lock the knee tight by pressing the back of the thigh to the calf. Next swing the leg across in front of your torso, swiveling from the hip and not the knee, and nestle the outside edge of the foot into the inner left groin. Be sure to bring the right knee as close to the left as possible and press the right heel into the left lower belly. Ideally the sole of the foot is perpendicular to the floor, not parallel.
Now lean back slightly, pick the right leg up off the floor, and lift the left leg in front of the right. To do this hold the underside of the left shin in your hands. Carefully slide the left leg over the right, snuggling the edge of the left foot deep into the right groin. Again swivel into position from the hip joint, pressing the heel against the lower belly, and arrange the sole perpendicular to the floor. Draw the knees as close together as possible. Use the edges of the feet to press the groins toward the floor and lift through the top of the sternum. If you wish, you can place the hands palms up in jnana mudra, with the thumbs and first fingers touching.
Padmasana is the sitting asana par excellence, but it's not for everybody. Experienced students can use it as a seat for their daily pranayama or meditation, but beginners may need to use other suitable positions. In the beginning, only hold the pose for a few seconds and quickly release. Remember that Padmasana is a two-sided pose, so be sure to work with both leg crosses each time you practice. Gradually add a few seconds each week to your pose until you can sit comfortably for a minute or so. Ideally you should work with a teacher to monitor your progress.
